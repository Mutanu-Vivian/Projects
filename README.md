# **WEATHER ANALYSIS PROJECT** <br>
## **The Project**  
The weather data used was sourced from Kaggle (_I opted to download the csv file_), and analysed the data using Python Language in Jupyter Notebooks,hosted on the Anaconda platform. The project seeks to give output and to provide insights into the following tasks:  
1. Find all records where the weather was exactly clear.  
2. Find the number of times the wind speed was exactly 4 km/hr.  
3. Check if there are any NULL values present in the dataset.  
4. Rename the column "Weather" to "Weather_Condition."  
5. What is the mean visibility of the dataset?  
6. Find the number of records where the wind speed is greater than 24 km/hr and visibility is equal to 25 km.  
7. What is the mean value of each column for each weather condition?  
8. Find all instances where the weather is clear and the relative humidity is greater than 50, or visibility is above 40.  
9. Find the number of weather conditions that include snow. <br/>

## **Challenges and Key Learnings**  
Having no prior interaction with any of the applications I used in this project, I encountered challenges with navigating Jupyter Notebooks, especially when loading the csv file, and following the correct syntax while writing the code for each task. 
My Take-out:  
1. Learning how to load and transfer data from one platform to another.
2. The importance of spelling, punctuation and case-sensitivity when writing Python code. <br/>

I am looking forward to learning so much more, and to contribute to this field of Data Science.
Thank you for taking time to check out my work!
